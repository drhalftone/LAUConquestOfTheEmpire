# Galley and Naval Rules - Conquest of the Empire (1984 Milton Bradley)

## Galley Movement

- **Independent Movement:** Galleys are the only units that can move without a General/Caesar
- **Movement Points:** Galleys can move up to 2 sea zones per turn
- **Transport Required:** Galleys are required for legions to cross the Mediterranean or other bodies of water

## Transport Rules

- **Capacity:** Only one general per galley may be on board
- **Maximum Galleys:** A player may own a maximum of six galleys
- **Placement:** New galleys are placed on the coast of the home province (or nearest coast if landlocked)
- **Notification:** If there are units inside the galley, this must be notified to other players

## Embarking and Disembarking

- **Movement Cost:** Embarking or disembarking from a coast requires one troop movement (0.5 moves in our implementation)
- **Leader Requirement:** A Leader cannot remain onboard a galley while troops disembark - the Leader must accompany the troops
- **Same Turn Restriction:** A unit cannot disembark and then re-embark in the same turn
- **Movement Limitation:** Units cannot move either before embarkation or after disembarkation
- **End Turn:** A Legion must end its turn in the province in which it disembarks

## Naval Combat

### Combat Initiation
- Galleys may fight galleys within the same sea zone
- **Combat is VOLUNTARY** - unlike land combat where engagement is mandatory
- Galleys can freely move through sea zones containing enemy galleys

### Combat Resolution
- One die is rolled for each galley in the "battle navy"
- Roll to equal or exceed the target's strength value (1984 strength-based system)
- **Cavalry have reduced strength in naval battles**

### Galley Destruction
- A galley can only be attacked after all **troops** aboard have been destroyed
- **Generals can "swim"** - they do not protect the galley from being targeted
- To sink a galley, roll 4, 5, or 6 (50% chance)
- If a force is destroyed, the losing general(s) are captured by the winner at the end of combat

### Swimming Generals
- When all troops on a galley are destroyed, the galley becomes targetable
- The general remains "swimming" while the galley can be attacked
- Swimming generals are dealt with at the end of combat (capture or kill)
- A general cannot protect an empty galley - troops are required for defense

### Galleys in Land Combat
- Galleys on shore which brought land units into a province **never count for land combat purposes**
- Galleys do not participate in ensuing land combat after an amphibious assault

## Sea Territory Ownership

- Sea territories (sea zones) are **never owned** by any player
- No colored borders are drawn for sea territories
- Moving through or occupying a sea zone does not claim it

## Strategic Notes

- An enemy galley in a sea zone may prohibit movement across a strait (unless the galley's owner allows it)
- Galleys provide critical strategic control of sea lanes
- Naval supremacy can isolate enemy provinces
