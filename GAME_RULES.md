# Conquest of the Empire (1984) - Game Rules Summary

## Overview
**Conquest of the Empire** is a military strategy board game set in the Roman Empire after the death of Marcus Aurelius. 2-6 players command armies attempting to become the ruler of Rome by capturing opponents' Caesars.

## Game Objective
**Primary Victory Condition:** Capture all opponent Caesars to eliminate them from the game. The last player with a surviving Caesar wins.

## Starting Setup

### Initial Resources (Per Player)
- **1 Caesar** (Leader piece)
- **6 Generals** (Commander pieces)
- **4 Infantry** (Combat units)
- **1 Home Province** with a fortified city

### Home Provinces
Six starting locations available:
- Hispania
- Italia
- Macedonia
- Numidia
- Egypt
- Galatia

### Starting Income
- **15 talents** total
  - 10 talents from home province
  - 5 talents from city

## Turn Sequence

Each player's turn consists of **6 phases** in order:

1. **Movement Phase** - Reposition units across the board
2. **Combat Phase** - Resolve battles in contested provinces
3. **Collect Tribute Phase** - Gather income from controlled territories
4. **Destroy Cities Phase** - (Optional) Demolish own cities to deny enemy benefits
5. **Purchase New Pieces Phase** - Buy military units and infrastructure
6. **Place New Pieces Phase** - Deploy newly acquired units

## Movement Rules

### Standard Movement
- **Combat Units:** Must be attached to a General or Caesar to move
- **Without Roads:** Units move 1 province per turn
- **With Roads:** Unlimited movement along connected road networks
- **Generals/Caesars:** Can move up to 2 provinces independently through controlled territory
  - Cannot fight alone (no combat strength)
  - Can be captured if province is invaded

### Legions
- **Legion Composition:** Up to 5 combat pieces + 1 General/Caesar = 6 pieces total
- **Legion Movement:** Entire legion moves as a single unit
- **Maximum Size:** 6 pieces (enforced)

### Special Units
- **Galleys (Ships):** Only independent units; move up to 2 sea provinces without escort

## Combat System

### Combat Initiation
Combat occurs when a player moves units into an enemy-occupied province.

### Combat Mechanics
1. Each side forms a "combat legion" from pieces in the province
2. Both players roll dice equal to their legion size (max 6 dice)
3. Dice show unit type symbols: Infantry (×2 faces), Cavalry, Catapult, Galley, or Blank
4. Matching rolled symbols to owned units scores hits
5. Players remove casualties equal to hits scored against them
6. Either side may retreat, or combat continues with new round
7. If retreat occurs, attacker gets final cavalry pursuit attempt

### Combat Priority
- **Generals/Caesars are removed last** - they can only be captured when all other legion units are destroyed
- Capturing an opponent's Caesar **immediately eliminates that player** from the game
- Winner gains all their territory, money, and troops

### Fortification Bonus
- A fortified city gives defending legions **+1 defensive bonus**

## Provinces and Territory

### Province Conquest
- Moving into and winning combat in an enemy province captures it
- Captured provinces provide tribute income
- Province values are marked on the game board

### Tribute Collection
- Collected at end of each turn (Phase 3)
- Income based on controlled provinces and cities
- Starting: 15 talents (10 from province + 5 from city)
- Income adjusts when provinces are gained/lost

## Purchasing System

### Unit Costs (Base Prices)

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Infantry | 10 talents |
| Road | 10 talents |
| Cavalry | 20 talents |
| Galley | 20 talents |
| Fortification (Wall) | 20 talents |
| Catapult | 30 talents |
| City | 30 talents |
| Fortified City | 50 talents |

### Inflation System
**Triggered by total wealth accumulation:**
- **First Trigger (100 talents):** All prices double (×2) for ALL players permanently
- **Second Trigger (200 talents):** All prices triple (×3) for ALL players permanently

This makes early expansion more economical than late-game purchases.

### Placement Rules
- **Combat Units** (Infantry, Cavalry, Catapult): Must be placed in player's **home province only**
- **Galleys:** Placed on coast of home province (or nearest coast if landlocked)
- **Cities:** Can be placed in any province you control (one city per province maximum)
- **Fortifications:** Can be placed in any city you control (one fortification per city maximum)
- **Roads:** Connect adjacent provinces that both contain cities

## Building and Infrastructure

### Cities
- **Limit:** One city per province
- **Benefit:** Provides additional tribute income
- **Requirement:** Must be placed in controlled province
- **Can be destroyed** by owner to deny enemy benefits

### Fortifications (Walls)
- **Limit:** One fortification per city
- **Benefit:** +1 defensive bonus in combat
- **Requirement:** Must be attached to a city

### Roads
- **Cost:** 10 talents
- **Benefit:** Allow unlimited movement along connected road networks
- **Requirement:** Can only connect adjacent provinces that both have cities

## Strategic Elements

### Leader Capture
- Capturing a General: Standard casualty
- **Capturing a Caesar: Eliminates that player entirely**
  - Winner receives all their territories
  - Winner receives all their money (talents)
  - Winner receives all their troops

### Prisoner Exchanges
Players may negotiate prisoner exchanges (mentioned as strategic option in rules).

### City Destruction
Players can destroy their own cities during Phase 4 to:
- Prevent enemy from collecting tribute
- Break enemy road networks
- Deny strategic positions

## Key Differences: 1984 vs 2005 Edition

The 2005 re-release modified the combat system. The information above primarily reflects the **1984 classic rules**, which use a dice-matching combat system.

## Additional Notes

### Legion Command
- A legion **may be stationed without a commander** in a province if it contains a city
- However, it cannot move until a General or Caesar arrives

### Maximum Force Limits
- Maximum of 7 units can be grouped together (including commander)
- Legions for movement are limited to 6 pieces (5 combat + 1 commander)

## Summary of Turn Order

1. **Move** your legions and leaders
2. **Fight** battles in contested provinces
3. **Collect** tribute from controlled territories
4. **Destroy** cities if desired (optional strategic choice)
5. **Purchase** new units and buildings with talents
